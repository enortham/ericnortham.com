            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’ve lived in Mexico City since 2012, where I’m always trying new restaurants and staying active—gymnastic rings are my current go‑to, but I also run, lift weights, and play sports when I
  can, especially anything with a racket or paddle. Originally from Washington, DC, I’ve been abroad since 2005—six years in Buenos Aires, two years traveling the world, and now deeply rooted here. I also
  speak Spanish. At home it’s me, my 12-year-old son, and two cats: Isidro and Poof.</p>
            
            <p>I studied Computer Science at UMBC and Takushoku University in Tokyo, where I eventually learned to speak Japanese well (and then subsequently forgot it). I still love to program, mainly in <span class="highlight">Ruby</span>, but I'm equally passionate about design, product, entrepreneurship, writing and everything AI.</p>

            <h2>My Work</h2>
            <p>I'm the Founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.easybroker.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EasyBroker</a>, which I started in 2007 while living in Buenos Aires. We've built Mexico's leading Real Estate CRM, <span class="highlight">100% bootstrapped</span>.</p>
            
            <p>I came to Mexico because EasyBroker took off here, and I wanted to be closer to my clients and truly understand the market. Recently, we launched <a href="https://www.pincali.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pincali</a>, a real estate portal with an ambitious goal: to become the leading source for finding homes to buy or rent in Mexico.</p>

          <h2>Mexico City</h2>
          <p>
            I’ve lived in Mexico City since 2012 and I’ve built a short list of places I like—restaurants, cafés, neighborhoods, and practical tips for getting around.
            I originally put it together for friends visiting from abroad, and I keep it updated whenever something new becomes a favorite.
